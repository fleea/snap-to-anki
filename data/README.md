# Data Directory Structure

The `/data` directory is used to organize and store all files related to the processing of study materials for conversion into Anki flashcards. Each book you process should have its own subdirectory within `/data` for input files, and a corresponding subdirectory within `/output` for the output files.

## Directory Structure
