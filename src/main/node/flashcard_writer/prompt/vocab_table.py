## VOCABULARY TABLE GUIDELINES

- Format the front of the card with the term/word
- Format the back of the card with the definition/translation and any additional context
- Preserve any special formatting, examples, or usage notes
- If the table has multiple columns, include all relevant information on the back of the card
- For tables with grammatical information, include that on the back of the card

## OUTPUT STRUCTURE
For each row in the vocabulary table, create a flashcard with this structure:
- Front: The term/vocabulary word (in the source language)
- Back: Definition, translation, examples, and any other relevant information

## IMPORTANT NOTES
- Maintain the language of the original content
- Preserve any special characters or formatting
- Do not add information that isn't present in the original table
- If the table has headers, use them to understand the structure but don't include them in each card
